# Contract Template

This is a contract that I put together in 2021 when I was freelancing. I used several publicly available contracts to assemble and then customize it.

- Its important to note that in the payment area, there are two options. One is for hourly pay and the other is project-based. Only one should be sent per contract: either agree to an hourly rate or agree to a project-based fee. Delete the unused option before submitting it for client review.
- All of the parts of the contract that should be edited are highlighted in yellow to make it easy to update for new clients or projects.
