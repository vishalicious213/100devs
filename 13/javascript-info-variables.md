## Working with variables

1. Declare two variables: admin and name.

```js
let admin
let name
```

2. Assign the value "John" to name.

```js
let name = "John"
```

3. Copy the value from name to admin.

```js
let admin - name
```

4. Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).

```js
alert(admin)
```

## Giving the right name

1. Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?

```js
let ourPlanet = "Earth"
```

2. Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?

```js
let currentVisitor
```
